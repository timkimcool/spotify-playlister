# Spotify Playlister
[Spotify playlister](https://spotify-profile-utility.herokuapp.com/) was developed using Django, Python, HTML/CSS, and [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). This app allows users to see their listening profile, add tracks to their playlist, and find music based on their listening profile. Unfortunately, the app is still in developer mode and so requires users to be added to the app before they can access it. Please let me know if you would like to try out the app!
